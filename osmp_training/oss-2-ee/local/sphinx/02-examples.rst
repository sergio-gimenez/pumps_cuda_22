Examples using OmpSs-2
======================

In this section we include several OmpSs-2 applications that are already
parallelized (i.e. annotated with OmpSs-2 directives). Users have not to
change the code, but they are encouraged to experiment with them. You can
also use that source directory to experiment with the different compiler
and runtime options, as well as the different runtime versions provided
with your OmpSs-2 installation.
